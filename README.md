# 02-Advanced-CSS-Portfolio
## Description
The task of this project was to take existing functioning code and to refactor it to be more efficient and accessable.  The original CSS file was overly complex and inefficient. To create a more streamlined and professional code,semantic elements were used to replace existing generic tags. Certain elements were trimmed down and consolidated to make the code more efficient and readable.
